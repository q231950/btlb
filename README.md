## Build the App

Initial setup:

**Setup**

Create the file (`Secrets.xcconfig`) that contains your secrets.

```
mv Secrets.sample.xcconfig Secrets.xcconfig
```

The AI recommender uses an OpenRouter API key
This file is ignored by Git to prevent secrets from being committed. Another ignored file is

`Classes/Generated/BuildConfig.swift`

This file gets generated by a _Build Phase Script_ using input from the `Secrets.xcconfig`.

**Build the `paper` library**

```shell
# Navigate to the paper directory and install the Rust toolchain
cd Packages/shared/paper
make prepare-apple
```

Whenever the Rust `paper` library is updated:
```shell
cd Packages/shared/paper/paper

# then either build the `Paper` Swift Package to use the Rust `paper` library from iOS during development
make apple

# or include release version of `paper` in the `Paper` Swift Package
make apple-release
```
